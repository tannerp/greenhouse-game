## Instructions

We're going to build a deep-water hydroponic greenhouse! If you're new to the industry, you can get a [video primer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0yHx1amD0). Our game is scaffolded out with two areas:

1. **Germination** - The area where seeds are planted into trays, and grown for about 10 days (depending on variety and time of year). Our greenhouse uses racks to hold the trays.
2. **Production** - The area where the lettuce is grown to maturity, in rafts that float on pools. There are 3 pools.

Each day, a raft is moved into each production pool. The rafts are pulled along the pools, making room for a new raft each day.

Prior to the interview, please fork this repo into codesandbox.io. During the interview, feel free to take the development of this game any direction you would like! Add a harvest mechanism, change the mechanics of planting, add a disease ... or anything else you'd like to tackle.
